# Design and Validation of an IoT System for an Experimental Laboratory Microgrid

Abstract: In the energy transition context, electrical microgrids facilitate the integration of renewable generation into the electrical grid, improving the electrical system's reliability and accelerating its decarbonization. However, to promote the technological advancement of these grids, it is necessary to develop tools to validate new technologies and solutions, such as using the Internet of Things (IoT) for their operation and control. This work presents the design, implementation, and validation of an IoT system for an experimental laboratory microgrid developed at Universidad Industrial de Santander. The main design phases of the IoT system are described, beginning with the definition of requirements and extending through the component selection. Validation tests are proposed to verify the functionalities of the IoT system. The results demonstrate that the IoT system successfully enables the transmission and reception of data from external users and servers. The reported experience and the proposed validation tests are relevant for researchers interested in implementing IoT-based stages in existing or future laboratory microgrids.
